# Decision_Tree_with_Python
I first created python script that only takes values for features & give prediction but without storing data.

ðŸ§  Decision Tree Web App (Streamlit) 
In Streamlit app, I ended this problem & let users train a custom decision tree model with one or more features. Users can enter feature names and values, train the model, and make real-time predictions. The app displays and supports named inputs for clarity. No pre-uploaded dataset requiredâ€”users manually input data for full control and learning. Ideal for students and beginners to understand how decision tree id3 works step-by-step. But, Can also be used to make some predictions.
